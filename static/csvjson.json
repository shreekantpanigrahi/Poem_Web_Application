carrol sweet,\nThat all the sences they doe ravish quite,\nThe whyles the boyes run up and downe the street,\nCrying aloud with strong confused noyce,\nAs if it were one voyce.\nHymen io Hymen, Hymen

golden wyre,\nSprinckled with perle, and perling flowres a tweene,\nDoe lyke a golden mantle her attyre,\nAnd being crowned with a girland greene,\nSeeme lyke some mayden Queene.\nHer modest eyes abashed to behold\nSo many gazers, as on her do stare,\nUpon the lowly ground affixed are.\nNe dare lift up her countenance too bold,\nBut blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,\nSo farre from being

will,\nNe thought of thing uncomely ever may\nThereto approch to tempt her mind to ill.\nHad ye once seene these her celestial threasures,\nAnd unrevealed pleasures,\nThen would ye wonder and her

ye virgins learne obedience,\nWhen so ye come into those holy places,\nTo humble your proud faces;\nBring her up to th'high altar that she may,\nThe sacred ceremonies there partake,\nThe which do

her cheekes,\nAnd the pure snow with goodly vermill stayne,\nLike crimsin dyde in grayne,\nThat even th'Angels which continually,\nAbout the sacred Altare doe remaine,\nForget their service and about her fly,\nOfte peeping in her face that seemes more fayre,\nThe more they on it stare.\nBut her sad eyes still fastened on the ground,\nAre governed with goodly modesty,\nThat suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,\nWhich may let in a little thought unsownd.\nWhy blush ye love to give to me your hand,\nThe pledge of all our band?\nSing ye sweet Angels, Alleluya sing,\nThat all the woods may answere

restraint or stay,\nPoure not by cups, but by the belly full,\nPoure out to all that wull,\nAnd sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,\nThat they may sweat, and drunken be withall.\nCrowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,\nAnd Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine,\nAnd let the Graces daunce unto the rest;\nFor they can doo it best:\nThe whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,\nTo which the woods shal answer and theyr eccho ring.\n\nRing ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,\nAnd leave your wonted labors for this day:\nThis day is holy; doe ye write it downe,\nThat ye for ever it remember may.\nThis day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,\nWith Barnaby the bright,\nFrom whence declining daily by degrees,\nHe somewhat loseth of his heat and light,\nWhen once the Crab behind his back he sees.\nBut for this time it ill ordained was,\nTo chose the longest day in all the yeare,\nAnd shortest night, when longest fitter weare:\nYet never day so long, but late would passe.\nRing ye

end,\nAnd lende me leave to come unto my love?\nHow slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?\nHow slowly does sad Time his feathers move?\nHast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home\nWithin the Westerne fome:\nThy tyred steedes long since have need of rest.\nLong though it be, at last I see it gloome,\nAnd the bright evening star with golden creast\nAppeare out of the East.\nFayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of love\nThat all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,\nAnd guydest lovers through the nightes dread,\nHow chearefully thou lookest from above,\nAnd seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light\nAs joying in the sight\nOf these glad many which for joy doe sing,\nThat all the woods them answer and their echo ring.\n\nNow ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast;\nEnough is it,

storms or sad afray:\nLyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,\nWhen he begot the great Tirynthian groome:\nOr lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie,\nAnd begot Majesty.\nAnd let the mayds and yongmen cease to sing:\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\n\nLet no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,\nBe heard all night within nor yet without:\nNe let false whispers, breeding

Pouke, nor other evill sprights,\nNe let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,\nNe let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,\nFray us with things that be not.\nLet not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard:\nNor the night Raven that still deadly yels,\nNor damned ghosts cald up with mighty spels,\nNor griesly vultures make us once affeard:\nNe let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking\nMake us to wish theyr choking.\nLet none of these theyr drery accents sing;\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\n\nBut let stil Silence trew night watches keepe,\nThat sacred peace may in assurance rayne,\nAnd tymely sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,\nMay poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne,\nThe whiles an hundred little winged loves,\nLike divers fethered doves,\nShall fly and flutter round about your bed,\nAnd in the secret darke, that none reproves,\nTheir prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal spread\nTo filch away sweet snatches of delight,\nConceald through covert night.\nYe sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will,\nFor greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,\nThinks more upon her paradise of joyes,\nThen what ye do, albe it good or ill.\nAll night therefore attend your merry play,\nFor it will soone be day:\nNow none doth hinder you, that say or sing,\nNe will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.\n\nWho is the same, which at my window peepes?\nOr whose is that faire face, that shines so bright,\nIs it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,\nBut walkes about high heaven al the night?\nO fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy\nMy love with me to spy:\nFor thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,\nAnd for a fleece of woll, which privily,\nThe Latmian shephard once unto thee brought,\nHis pleasures with thee wrought.\nTherefore to us be favorable now;\nAnd sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,\nAnd generation goodly dost enlarge,\nEncline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,\nAnd the chast wombe informe with timely seed,\nThat may our comfort breed:\nTill which we cease our hopefull hap to sing,\nNe let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.\n\nAnd thou great Juno, which with awful might\nThe lawes of wedlock still dost patronize,\nAnd the religion of the faith first plight\nWith sacred rites hast taught to solemnize:\nAnd eeke for comfort often called art\nOf women in their smart,\nEternally bind thou this lovely band,\nAnd all thy blessings unto us impart.\nAnd thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand,\nThe bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,\nWithout blemish or staine,\nAnd the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight\nWith secret ayde doest succour and supply,\nTill they bring forth the fruitfull progeny,\nSend us the timely fruit of this same night.\nAnd thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen free,\nGrant that it may so be.\nTil which we cease your further prayse to sing,\nNe any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho ring.\n\nAnd ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,\nIn which a thousand torches flaming bright\nDoe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods,\nIn dreadful darknesse lend desired light;\nAnd all ye powers which in the same remayne,\nMore then we men can fayne,\nPoure out your blessing on us plentiously,\nAnd happy influence upon us raine,\nThat we may raise a large posterity,\nWhich from the earth, which they may long possesse,\nWith lasting happinesse,\nUp to your haughty pallaces may mount,\nAnd for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit\nMay heavenly tabernacles there inherit,\nOf blessed Saints for to increase the count.\nSo let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,\nAnd cease till then our tymely joyes to sing,\nThe woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring.\n\nSong made in lieu of many ornaments,\nWith which my love should duly have bene dect,\nWhich cutting off through hasty accidents,\nYe would not stay your dew time to expect,\nBut promist both to recompens,\nBe unto her a goodly ornament,\nAnd for short time an endlesse moniment.",

    "content": "On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,\nIn view and opposite two cities stood,\nSea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;\nThe one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.\nAt Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\nAnd offer'd as a dower his burning throne,\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\nHer wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\nFrom whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\nWhen 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\nWhich lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.\nShe ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind\nWould burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,\nOr warm or cool them, for they took delight\nTo play upon those hands, they were so white.\nBuskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,\nAnd branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;\nWhere sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,\nSuch as the world would wonder to behold:\nThose with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,\nWhich as she went, would chirrup through the bills.\nSome say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,\nAnd looking in her face, was strooken blind.\nBut this is true; so like was one the other,\nAs he imagin'd Hero was his mother;\nAnd oftentimes into her bosom flew,\nAbout her naked neck his bare arms threw,\nAnd laid his childish head upon her breast,\nAnd with still panting rock'd there took his rest.\nSo lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,\nAs Nature wept, thinking she was undone,\nBecause she took more from her than she left,\nAnd of such wondrous beauty her bereft:\nTherefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,\nSince Hero's time hath half the world been black.\n\n         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young\n(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),\nDwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none\nFor whom succeeding times make greater moan.\nHis dangling tresses, that were never shorn,\nHad they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,\nWould have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece\nTo hazard more than for the golden fleece.\nFair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;\nGrief makes her pale, because she moves not there.\nHis body was as straight as Circe's wand;\nJove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.\nEven as delicious meat is to the taste,\nSo was his neck in touching, and surpast\nThe white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,\nHow smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\nAnd whose immortal fingers did imprint\nThat heavenly path with many a curious dint\nThat runs along his back; but my rude pen\nCan hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\nMuch less of powerful gods: let it suffice\nThat my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;\nThose orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his\nThat leapt into the water for a kiss\nOf his own shadow, and, despising many,\nDied ere he could enjoy the love of any.\nHad wild Hippolytus Leander seen,\nEnamour'd of his beauty had he been.\nHis presence made the rudest peasant melt,\nThat in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\nThe barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,\nWas mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.\nSome swore he was a maid in man's attire,\nFor in his looks were all that men desire,\nA pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\nA brow for love to banquet royally;\nAnd such as knew he was a man, would say,\n\"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\nWhy art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?\nThough thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\"\n\n         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,\nFor his sake whom their goddess held so dear,\nRose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.\nThither resorted many a wandering guest\nTo meet their loves; such as had none at all\nCame lovers home from this great festival;\nFor every street, like to a firmament,\nGlister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,\nFrighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd\nEternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd\nAs if another Pha{\"e}ton had got\nThe guidance of the sun's rich chariot.\nBut far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,\nAnd stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;\nFor like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,\nSo was her beauty to the standers-by;\nNor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star\n(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car\nFrom Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,\nWhere, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,\nShe proudly sits) more over-rules the flood\nThan she the hearts of those that near her stood.\nEven as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,\nWretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,\nIncens'd with savage heat, gallop amain\nFrom steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,\nSo ran the people forth to gaze upon her,\nAnd all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.\nAnd as in fury of a dreadful fight,\nTheir fellows being slain or put to flight,\nPoor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,\nSo at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,\nAwait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\nHe whom she favours lives; the other dies.\nThere might you see one sigh, another rage,\nAnd some, their violent passions to assuage,\nCompile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,\nFor faithful love will never turn to hate.\nAnd many, seeing great princes were denied,\nPin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.\nOn this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!\nWent Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower\nTo Venus' temple, where unhappily,\nAs after chanc'd, they did each other spy.\nSo fair a church as this had Venus none:\nThe walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,\nWherein was Proteus carved; and over-head\nA lively vine of green sea-agate spread,\nWhere by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,\nAnd with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.\nOf crystal shining fair the pavement was;\nThe town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:\nThere might you see the gods in sundry shapes,\nCommitting heady riots, incest, rapes:\nFor know, that underneath this radiant flower\nWas Danae's statue in a brazen tower,\nJove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,\nTo dally with Idalian Ganimed,\nAnd for his love Europa bellowing loud,\nAnd tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;\nBlood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,\nWhich limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;\nLove kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,\nSylvanus weeping for the lovely boy\nThat now is turn'd into a cypress tree,\nUnder whose shade the wood-gods love to be.\nAnd in the midst a silver altar stood:\nThere Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,\nVail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;\nAnd modestly they opened as she rose.\nThence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;\nAnd thus Leander was enamoured.\nStone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,\nTill with the fire that from his count'nance blazed\nRelenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:\nSuch force and virtue hath an amorous look.\n\n         It lies not in our power to love or hate,\nFor will in us is over-rul'd by fate.\nWhen two are stript, long ere the course begin,\nWe wish that one should lose, the other win;\nAnd one especially do we affect\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\nThe reason no man knows, let it suffice,\nWhat we behold is censur'd by our eyes.\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\nWho ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",

the violet pallid blue,\nThe little daisy, that at evening closes,\nThe virgin lily, and the primrose true,\nWith store of vermeil roses,\nTo deck their bridegrooms' posies\nAgainst the bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nWith that, I saw two swans of goodly hue\nCome softly swimming down along the Lee;\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see.\nThe snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,\nDid never whiter shew,\nNor Jove himself, when he a swan would be\nFor love of Leda, whiter did appear:\nYet Leda was they say as white as he,\nYet not so white as these, nor nothing near.\nSo purely white they were,\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\nSeemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare\nTo wet their silken feathers, lest they might\nSoil their fair plumes with water not so fair,\nAnd mar their beauties bright,\nThat shone as heaven's light,\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nEftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,\nRan all in haste, to see that silver brood,\nAs they came floating on the crystal flood.\nWhom when they saw, they stood amazed still,\nTheir wondering eyes to fill.\nThem seemed they never saw a sight so fair,\nOf fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem\nThem heavenly born, or to be that same pair\nWhich through the sky draw Venus' silver team;\nFor sure they did not seem\nTo be begot of any earthly seed,\nBut rather angels, or of angels' breed:\nYet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,\nIn sweetest season, when each flower and weed\nThe earth did fresh array,\nSo fresh they seemed as day,\nEven as their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nThen forth they all out of their baskets drew\nGreat store of flowers, the honour of the field,\nThat to the sense did fragrant odours yield,\nAll which upon those goodly birds they threw,\nAnd all the waves did strew,\nThat like old Peneus' waters they did seem,\nWhen down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,\nScattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,\nThat they appear through lilies' plenteous store,\nLike a bride's chamber floor.\nTwo of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,\nOf freshest flowers which in that mead they found,\nThe which presenting all in trim array,\nTheir snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,\nWhilst one did sing this lay,\nPrepared against that day,\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\n'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,\nAnd heaven's glory, whom this happy hour\nDoth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,\nJoy may you have and gentle heart's content\nOf your love's complement:\nAnd let fair Venus, that is queen of love,\nWith her heart-quelling son upon you smile,\nWhose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove\nAll love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile\nFor ever to assoil.\nLet endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,\nAnd blessed plenty wait upon your board,\nAnd let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,\nThat fruitful issue may to you afford,\nWhich may your foes confound,\nAnd make your joys redound\nUpon your bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'\n\nSo ended she; and all the rest around\nTo her redoubled that her undersong,\nWhich said their bridal day should not be long.\nAnd gentle echo from the neighbour ground\nTheir accents did resound.\nSo forth those joyous birds did pass along,\nAdown the Lee, that to them murmured low,\nAs he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,\nYet did by signs his glad affection show,\nMaking his stream run slow.\nAnd all the fowl which in his flood did dwell\nGan flock about these twain, that did excel\nThe rest so far as Cynthia doth shend\nThe lesser stars. So they, enranged well,\nDid on those two attend,\nAnd their best service lend,\nAgainst their wedding day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nAt length they all to merry London came,\nTo merry London, my most kindly nurse,\nThat to me gave this life's first native source;\nThough from another place I take my name,\nAn house of ancient fame.\nThere when they came, whereas those bricky towers,\nThe which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,\nWhere now the studious lawyers have their bowers\nThere whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,\nTill they decayed through pride:\nNext whereunto there stands a stately place,\nWhere oft I gained gifts and goodly grace\nOf that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,\nWhose want too well now feels my friendless case.\nBut ah, here fits not well\nOld woes but joys to tell\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nYet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,\nGreat England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,\nWhose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,\nAnd Hercules' two pillars standing near\nDid make to quake and fear:\nFair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,\nThat fillest England with thy triumph's fame,\nJoy have thou of thy noble victory,\nAnd endless happiness of thine own name\nThat promiseth the same:\nThat through thy prowess and victorious arms,\nThy country may be freed from foreign harms;\nAnd great Elisa's glorious name may ring\nThrough all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,\nWhich some brave Muse may sing\nTo ages following,\nUpon the bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nFrom those high towers this noble lord issuing,\nLike radiant Hesper when his golden hair\nIn th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,\nDescended to the river's open viewing,\nWith a great train ensuing.\nAbove the rest were goodly to be seen\nTwo gentle knights of lovely face and feature\nBeseeming well the bower of any queen,\nWith gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,\nFit for so goodly stature;\nThat like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,\nWhich deck the baldric of the heavens bright.\nThey two forth pacing to the river's side,\nReceived those two fair birds, their love's delight;\nWhich, at th' appointed tide,\nEach one did make his bride\nAgainst their bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",

rusts,\nAnd helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.\n\nThere may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,\nAnd stretch her selfe at large from East to West:\nWhither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,\nOr if thee

the violet pallid blue,\nThe little daisy, that at evening closes,\nThe virgin lily, and the primrose true,\nWith store of vermeil roses,\nTo deck their bridegrooms' posies\nAgainst the bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nWith that, I saw two swans of goodly hue\nCome softly swimming down along the Lee;\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see.\nThe snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,\nDid never whiter shew,\nNor Jove himself, when he a swan would be\nFor love of Leda, whiter did appear:\nYet Leda was they say as white as he,\nYet not so white as these, nor nothing near.\nSo purely white they were,\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\nSeemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare\nTo wet their silken feathers, lest they might\nSoil their fair plumes with water not so fair,\nAnd mar their beauties bright,\nThat shone as heaven's light,\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nEftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,\nRan all in haste, to see that silver brood,\nAs they came floating on the crystal flood.\nWhom when they saw, they stood amazed still,\nTheir wondering eyes to fill.\nThem seemed they never saw a sight so fair,\nOf fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem\nThem heavenly born, or to be that same pair\nWhich through the sky draw Venus' silver team;\nFor sure they did not seem\nTo be begot of any earthly seed,\nBut rather angels, or of angels' breed:\nYet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,\nIn sweetest season, when each flower and weed\nThe earth did fresh array,\nSo fresh they seemed as day,\nEven as their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nThen forth they all out of their baskets drew\nGreat store of flowers, the honour of the field,\nThat to the sense did fragrant odours yield,\nAll which upon those goodly birds they threw,\nAnd all the waves did strew,\nThat like old Peneus' waters they did seem,\nWhen down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,\nScattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,\nThat they appear through lilies' plenteous store,\nLike a bride's chamber floor.\nTwo of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,\nOf freshest flowers which in that mead they found,\nThe which presenting all in trim array,\nTheir snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,\nWhilst one did sing this lay,\nPrepared against that day,\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\n'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,\nAnd heaven's glory, whom this happy hour\nDoth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,\nJoy may you have and gentle heart's content\nOf your love's complement:\nAnd let fair Venus, that is queen of love,\nWith her heart-quelling son upon you smile,\nWhose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove\nAll love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile\nFor ever to assoil.\nLet endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,\nAnd blessed plenty wait upon your board,\nAnd let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,\nThat fruitful issue may to you afford,\nWhich may your foes confound,\nAnd make your joys redound\nUpon your bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'\n\nSo ended she; and all the rest around\nTo her redoubled that her undersong,\nWhich said their bridal day should not be long.\nAnd gentle echo from the neighbour ground\nTheir accents did resound.\nSo forth those joyous birds did pass along,\nAdown the Lee, that to them murmured low,\nAs he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,\nYet did by signs his glad affection show,\nMaking his stream run slow.\nAnd all the fowl which in his flood did dwell\nGan flock about these twain, that did excel\nThe rest so far as Cynthia doth shend\nThe lesser stars. So they, enranged well,\nDid on those two attend,\nAnd their best service lend,\nAgainst their wedding day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nAt length they all to merry London came,\nTo merry London, my most kindly nurse,\nThat to me gave this life's first native source;\nThough from another place I take my name,\nAn house of ancient fame.\nThere when they came, whereas those bricky towers,\nThe which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,\nWhere now the studious lawyers have their bowers\nThere whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,\nTill they decayed through pride:\nNext whereunto there stands a stately place,\nWhere oft I gained gifts and goodly grace\nOf that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,\nWhose want too well now feels my friendless case.\nBut ah, here fits not well\nOld woes but joys to tell\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nYet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,\nGreat England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,\nWhose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,\nAnd Hercules' two pillars standing near\nDid make to quake and fear:\nFair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,\nThat fillest England with thy triumph's fame,\nJoy have thou of thy noble victory,\nAnd endless happiness of thine own name\nThat promiseth the same:\nThat through thy prowess and victorious arms,\nThy country may be freed from foreign harms;\nAnd great Elisa's glorious name may ring\nThrough all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,\nWhich some brave Muse may sing\nTo ages following,\nUpon the bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nFrom those high towers this noble lord issuing,\nLike radiant Hesper when his golden hair\nIn th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,\nDescended to the river's open viewing,\nWith a great train ensuing.\nAbove the rest were goodly to be seen\nTwo gentle knights of lovely face and feature\nBeseeming well the bower of any queen,\nWith gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,\nFit for so goodly stature;\nThat like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,\nWhich deck the baldric of the heavens bright.\nThey two forth pacing to the river's side,\nReceived those two fair birds, their love's delight;\nWhich, at th' appointed tide,\nEach one did make his bride\nAgainst their bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",

reedes bene rent and wore:\nAnd my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,\nYet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,\nSuch pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,\nAnd ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.\n\nThe dapper ditties, that I wont devise,\nTo feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,\nDelighten much: what I the bett for thy?\nThey han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.\nI beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:\nWhat good thereof to Cuddie can arise?\n\nPIERS\nCuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,\nThe glory eke much greater then the gayne:\nO what an honor is it, to restraine\nThe lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:\nOr pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,\nWhereto thou list their trayned willes entice.\n\nSoone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,\nO how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:\nSeemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,\nAll as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame\nFrom Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:\nHis musicks might the hellish hound did tame.\n\nCUDDIE\nSo praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,\nAnd wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:\nBut who rewards him ere the more for thy?\nOr feedes him once the fuller by a graine?\nSike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,\nSike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.\n\nPIERS\nAbandon then the base and viler clowne,\nLyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:\nAnd sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.\nTurne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,\nTo doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,\nAnd helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.\n\nThere may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,\nAnd stretch her selfe at large from East to West:\nWhither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,\nOr if thee please in bigger notes to sing,\nAdvaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,\nThat first the white beare to the stake did bring.\n\nAnd when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,\nHas somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:\nOf love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,\nAnd carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,\nAll were Elisa one of thilke same ring.\nSo mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.\n\nCUDDYE\nIndeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,\nThrough his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,\nWhereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,\nAnd laboured lands to yield the timely eare,\nAnd eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,\nSo as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.\n\nBut ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,\nAnd great Augustus long ygoe is dead:\nAnd all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,\nThat matter made for Poets on to play:\nFor ever, who in derring doe were dreade,\nThe loftie verse of hem was loved aye.\n\nBut after vertue gan for age to stoupe,\nAnd mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:\nThe vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,\nTo put in preace emong the learned troupe.\nTho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,\nAnd sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.\n\nAnd if that any buddes of Poesie,\nYet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:\nOr it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,\nAnd rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:\nOr as it sprong, it wither must agayne:\nTom Piper makes us better melodie.\n\nPIERS\nO pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?\nIf nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:\n(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)\nNe brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.\nThen make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,\nAnd, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.\n\nCUDDIE\nAh Percy it is all to weake and wanne,\nSo high to sore, and make so large a flight:\nHer peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,\nFor Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:\nHe, were he not with love so ill bedight,\nWould mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.\n\nPIERS\nAh fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,\nAnd lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:\nSuch immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,\nWould rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.\nAnd cause a caytive corage to aspire,\nFor lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.\n\nCUDDIE\nAll otherwise the state of Poet stands,\nFor lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:\nThat where he rules, all power he doth expell.\nThe vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,\nNe wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.\nUnwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.\n\nWho ever casts to compasse weightye prise,\nAnd thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:\nLet powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,\nFor Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.\nAnd when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,\nThe nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.\n\nThou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.\nO if my temples were distaind with wine,\nAnd girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,\nHow I could reare the Muse on stately stage,\nAnd teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,\nWith queint Bellona in her equipage.\n\nBut ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,\nFor thy, content us in thys humble shade:\nWhere no such troublous tydes han us assayde,\nHere we our slender pipes may safely charme.\n\nPIERS\nAnd when my Gates shall han their bellies

and lose their goodly light.\n\nBut that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray\nThat light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,\nShall never be extinguish'd nor decay;\nBut when the vital spirits do expire,\nUnto her native planet shall retire;\nFor it is heavenly born and cannot die,\nBeing a parcel of the purest sky.\n\nFor when the soul, the which derived was,\nAt first, out of that great immortal Spright,\nBy whom all live to love, whilom did pass\nDown from the top of purest heaven's height\nTo be embodied here, it then took light\nAnd lively spirits from that fairest star,\nWhich lights the world forth from his fiery car.\n\nWhich power retaining still or more or less,\nWhen she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,\nThrough every part she doth the same impress,\nAccording as the heavens have her graced,\nAnd frames her house, in which she will be placed,\nFit for herself, adorning it with spoil\nOf th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.\n\nThereof it comes that these fair souls, which have\nThe most resemblance of that heavenly light,\nFrame to themselves most beautiful and brave\nTheir fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,\nAnd the gross matter by a sovereign might\nTempers so trim, that it may well be seen\nA palace fit for such a virgin queen.\n\nSo every spirit, as it is most pure,\nAnd hath in it the more of heavenly light,\nSo it the fairer body doth procure\nTo habit in, and it more fairly dight\nWith cheerful grace and amiable sight.\nFor of the soul the body form doth take:\nFor soul is form, and doth the body make.\n\nTherefore wherever that thou dost behold\nA comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,\nKnow this for certain, that the same doth hold\nA beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,\nFit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.\nFor all that fair is, is by nature good;\nThat is a sign to know the gentle blood.\n\nYet oft it falls that many a gentle mind\nDwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,\nEither by chance, against the course of kind,\nOr through unaptness in the substance found,\nWhich it assumed of some stubborn ground,\nThat will not yield unto her form's direction,\nBut is deform'd with some foul imperfection.\n\nAnd oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)\nThat goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,\nIs foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,\nWhich doth the world with her delight adorn,\nMade but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,\nWhilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,\nBut every one doth seek but to deprave it.\n\nYet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,\nBut theirs that do abuse it unto ill:\nNothing so good, but that through guilty shame\nMay be corrupt, and wrested unto will:\nNatheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,\nHowever flesh{\"e}s fault it filthy make;\nFor things immortal no corruption take.\n\nBut ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments\nAnd lively images of heaven's light,\nLet not your beams with such disparagements\nBe dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;\nBut mindful still of your first country's sight,\nDo still preserve your first informed grace,\nWhose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.\n\nLoathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,\nDisloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,\nThat base affections, which your ears would bland,\nCommend to you by love's abused name,\nBut is indeed the bondslave of defame;\nWhich will the garland of your glory mar,\nAnd quench the light of your bright shining star.\n\nBut gentle Love, that loyal is and true,\nWill more illumine your resplendent ray,\nAnd add more brightness to your goodly hue,\nFrom light of his pure fire; which, by like way\nKindled of yours, your likeness doth display;\nLike as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,\nDo both express the face's first impression.\n\nTherefore, to make your beauty more appear,\nIt you behoves to love, and forth to lay\nThat heavenly riches which in you ye bear,\nThat men the more admire their fountain may;\nFor else what booteth that celestial ray,\nIf it in darkness be enshrined ever,\nThat it of loving eyes be viewed never?\n\nBut, in your choice of loves, this well advise,\nThat likest to yourselves ye them select,\nThe which your forms' first source may sympathize,\nAnd with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;\nFor, if you loosely love without respect,\nIt is no love, but a discordant war,\nWhose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.\n\nFor love is a celestial harmony\nOf likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,\nWhich join together in sweet sympathy,\nTo work each other's joy and true content,\nWhich they have harbour'd since their first descent\nOut of their heavenly bowers, where they did see\nAnd know each other here belov'd to be.\n\nThen wrong it were that any other twain\nShould in love's gentle band combined be\nBut those whom Heaven did at first ordain,\nAnd made out of one mould the more t' agree;\nFor all that like the beauty which they see,\nStraight do not love; for love is not so light\nAs straight to burn at first beholder's sight.\n\nBut they, which love indeed, look otherwise,\nWith pure regard and spotless true intent,\nDrawing out of the object of their eyes\nA more refined form, which they present\nUnto their mind, void of all blemishment;\nWhich it reducing to her first perfection,\nBeholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.\n\nAnd then conforming it unto the light,\nWhich in itself it hath remaining still,\nOf that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,\nThereof he fashions in his higher skill\nAn heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;\nAnd it embracing in his mind entire,\nThe mirror of his own thought doth admire.\n\nWhich seeing now so inly fair to be,\nAs outward it appeareth to the eye,\nAnd with his spirit's proportion to agree,\nHe thereon fixeth all his fantasy,\nAnd fully setteth his felicity;\nCounting it fairer than it is indeed,\nAnd yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.\n\nFor lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be\nThan other men's, and in dear love's delight\nSee more than any other eyes can see,\nThrough mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,\nWhich carry privy message to the spright,\nAnd to their eyes that inmost fair display,\nAs plain as light discovers dawning day.\n\nTherein they see, through amorous eye-glances,\nArmies of loves still flying to and fro,\nWhich dart at them their little fiery lances;\nWhom having wounded, back again they go,\nCarrying compassion to their lovely foe;\nWho, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,\nCures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.\n\nIn which how many wonders do they rede\nTo their conceit, that others never see,\nNow of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,\nLike gods with nectar in their banquets free;\nNow of her looks, which like to cordials be;\nBut when her words' embassade forth she sends,\nLord, how sweet music that unto them lends.\n\nSometimes upon her forehead they behold\nA thousand graces masking in delight;\nSometimes within her eyelids they unfold\nTen thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight\nDo seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;\nBut on her lips, like rosy buds in May,\nSo many millions of chaste pleasures play.\n\nAll those, O Cytherea, and thousands more\nThy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,\nTo deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,\nThat may it more to mortal eyes commend,\nAnd make it more admir'd of foe and friend:\nThat in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,\nAnd spread thy lovely kingdom over all.\n\nThen Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,\nAdvance the banner of thy conquest high,\nThat all this world, the which thy vassals bene,\nMay draw to thee, and with due fealty\nAdore the power of thy great majesty,\nSinging this hymn in honour of thy name,\nCompil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.\n\nIn lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,\nThat she whose conquering beauty doth captive\nMy trembling heart in her eternal chain,\nOne drop of grace at length will to me give,\nThat I her bounden thrall by her may live,\nAnd this same life, which first fro me she reaved,\nMay owe to her, of whom I it received.\n\nAnd you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,\nFresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,\nWhen your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,\nDeign to let fall one drop of due relief,\nThat may recure my heart's long pining grief,\nAnd shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,\nThat can restore a damned wight from death.",

Hero the fair,\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\nAnd offer'd as a dower his burning throne,\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\nHer wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\nFrom whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\nWhen 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\nWhich lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.\nShe ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind\nWould burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,\nOr warm or cool them, for they took delight\nTo play upon those hands, they were so white.\nBuskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,\nAnd branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;\nWhere sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,\nSuch as the world would wonder to behold:\nThose with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,\nWhich as she went, would chirrup through the bills.\nSome say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,\nAnd looking in her face, was strooken blind.\nBut this is true;

since him dwelt there none\nFor whom succeeding times make greater moan.\nHis dangling tresses, that were never shorn,\nHad they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,\nWould have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece\nTo hazard more than for the golden fleece.\nFair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;\nGrief makes her pale, because she moves not there.\nHis body was as straight as Circe's wand;\nJove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.\nEven as delicious meat is to the taste,\nSo was his neck in touching, and surpast\nThe white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,\nHow smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\nAnd whose immortal fingers did imprint\nThat heavenly path with many a curious dint\nThat runs along his back; but my rude pen\nCan hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\nMuch less of powerful gods: let it suffice\nThat my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;\nThose orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his\nThat leapt into the water for a kiss\nOf his own shadow, and, despising many,\nDied ere he could enjoy the love of any.\nHad wild Hippolytus Leander seen,\nEnamour'd of his beauty had he been.\nHis presence made the rudest peasant melt,\nThat in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\nThe barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,\nWas mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.\nSome swore he was a maid in man's attire,\nFor in his looks were all that men desire,\nA pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\nA brow for love to banquet royally;\nAnd such as knew he was a man, would say,\n\"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\nWhy art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?\nThough thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\"\n\n         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,\nFor his sake whom their goddess held so dear,\nRose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.\nThither resorted many a wandering guest\nTo meet their loves; such as had none at all\nCame lovers home from this great festival;\nFor every street, like to a firmament,\nGlister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,\nFrighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd\nEternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd\nAs if another Pha{\"e}ton had got\nThe guidance of the sun's rich chariot.\nBut far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,\nAnd stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;\nFor like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,\nSo was her beauty to the standers-by;\nNor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star\n(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car\nFrom Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,\nWhere, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,\nShe proudly sits) more over-rules the flood\nThan she the hearts of those that near her stood.\nEven as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,\nWretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,\nIncens'd with savage heat, gallop amain\nFrom steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,\nSo ran the people forth to gaze upon her,\nAnd all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.\nAnd as in fury of a dreadful fight,\nTheir fellows being slain or put to flight,\nPoor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,\nSo at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,\nAwait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\nHe whom she favours lives; the other dies.\nThere might you see one sigh, another rage,\nAnd some, their violent passions to assuage,\nCompile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,\nFor faithful love will never turn to hate.\nAnd many, seeing great princes were denied,\nPin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.\nOn this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!\nWent Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower\nTo Venus' temple, where unhappily,\nAs after chanc'd, they did each other spy.\nSo fair a church as this had Venus none:\nThe walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,\nWherein was Proteus carved; and over-head\nA lively vine of green sea-agate spread,\nWhere by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,\nAnd with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.\nOf crystal shining fair the pavement was;\nThe town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:\nThere might you see the gods in sundry shapes,\nCommitting heady riots, incest, rapes:\nFor know, that underneath this radiant flower\nWas Danae's statue in a brazen tower,\nJove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,\nTo dally with Idalian Ganimed,\nAnd for his love Europa bellowing loud,\nAnd tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;\nBlood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,\nWhich limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;\nLove kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,\nSylvanus weeping for the lovely boy\nThat now is turn'd into a cypress tree,\nUnder whose shade the wood-gods love to be.\nAnd in the midst a silver altar stood:\nThere Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,\nVail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;\nAnd modestly they opened as she rose.\nThence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;\nAnd thus Leander was enamoured.\nStone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,\nTill with the fire that from his count'nance blazed\nRelenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:\nSuch force and virtue hath an amorous look.\n\n         It lies not in our power to love or hate,\nFor will in us is over-rul'd by fate.\nWhen two are stript, long ere the course begin,\nWe wish that one should lose, the other win;\nAnd one especially do we affect\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\nThe reason no man knows, let it suffice,\nWhat we behold is censur'd by our eyes.\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\nWho ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",

So that all that is ours \nFor inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays \nIs this: \nIn the name of God, how could they do it? \n\n\nII \nFor there is no new thing under the sun, \nOnly this uncomely man with a smoking gun \nIn the gloom. . . \nWhat the devil will he gain by it? \nDigging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it \nWaiting his doom; \nThe sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, \nTill the trench of gray mud \nIs turned to a brown purple drain by it. \nWell, there have been scars \nWon in many wars . . .\nPunic, \nLacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, \nBut this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, \nHis ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, \nOverspreading his miserable land, \nStanding with his wet gun in his hand . . . \nDoom! \nHe finds that in a sudden scrimmage, \nAnd lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . \nAn image that shall take long to pass! \n\n\nIII \nFor the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses \nForever through our brains. \nThe heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; \nAnd battalions and battalions and battalions \nThe Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, \nPass, for ever staunch, \nStand, for ever true; \nAnd the small man with the large paunch, \nAnd the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, \nWatches them pass \nIn our minds for ever . . . \nBut that clutter of sodden corses \nOn the sodden Belgian grass \nThat is a strange new beauty. \n\n\nIV \nWith no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, \nAssuredly that is the way of it, \nThe way of beauty . . . \nAnd that is the highest word you can find to say of it. \nFor you cannot praise it with words \nCompounded of lyres and swords, \nBut the thought of the gloom and the rain \nAnd the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, \nShall eat itself into your brain: \nAnd you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! \nAnd you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. \nAnd you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. \nAnd that shall be an honourable name; \nBelgian shall be an honourable word; \nAs honourable as the fame of the sword, \nAs honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, \nAnd his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. \n\n\nV \nAnd what in the world did they bear it for? \nI don't know. \nAnd what in the world did they dare it for? \nPerhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. \nThey could very well have watched a hundred legions go \nOver their fields and between their cities \nDown into more southerly regions. \nThey could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, \nAnd have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. \nI don't understand. \nWas it just love of their land? \nOh, poor dears! \nCan any man so love his land? \nGive them a thousand thousand pities \nAnd rivers and rivers of tears \nTo wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. \n\n\nVI \nThis is Charing Cross; \nIt is midnight; \nThere is a great crowd \nAnd no light. \nA great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. \nSurely, that is a dead womana dead mother! \nShe has a dead face; \nShe is dressed all in black; \nShe wanders to the bookstall and back, \nAt the back of the crowd; \nAnd back again and again back, \nShe sways and wanders. \n\nThis is Charing Cross; \nIt is one o'clock. \nThere is still a great cloud, and very little light; \nImmense shafts of shadows over the black crowd \nThat hardly whispers aloud. . . \nAnd now! .  . That is another dead mother, \nAnd there is another and another and another. . . \nAnd little children, all in black, \nAll with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, \nWandering from the doors of the waiting-room \nIn the dim gloom. \nThese are the women of Flanders.\nThey await the lost. \nThey await the lost that shall never leave the dock; \nThey await the lost that shall never again come by the train \nTo the embraces of all these women with dead faces; \nThey await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, \nIn the dark of the night. \nThis is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; \nThere is very little light. \n\nThere is so much pain. \n\n\nLEnvoi \nAnd it was for this that they endured this gloom; \nThis October like November, \nThat August like a hundred thousand hours, \nAnd that September, \nA hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, \nAnd half October like a thousand years. . . \nOh, poor dears!",

Originally part of what scholars call the \"Ur-Cantos,\" this version of Canto III was later edited by Pound to become Canto I of his collected Cantos. The section that eventually became Canto I is highlighted in blue in the poem below.\nTHE EDITORS\n\n\nIII\n\nAnother's a half-cracked fellowJohn Heydon,\nWorker of miracles, dealer in levitation,\nIn thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy,\nSeer of pretty visions (\"servant of God and secretary of nature\");         \nFull of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's,\nWith half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods.\nThus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton,\nHad such a sight:\nDecked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk\nSlit to the elbow, slashed with various purples.\nHer eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like.\nShe was adorned with choicest emeralds,\nAnd promised him the way of holy wisdom.\n\"Pretty green bank,\" began the half-lost poem.\nTake the old way, say I met John Heydon,         \nSought out the place,\nLay on the bank, was \"plunged deep in swevyn;\"\nAnd saw the companyLayamon, Chaucer\nPass each in his appropriate robes;\nConversed with each, observed the varying fashion.\nAnd then comes Heydon.\n                                 \"I have seen John Heydon.\"\nLet us hear John Heydon!\n                                 \"Omniformis\nOmnis intellectus est\"thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus.\n(Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator:\nNot Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances,\nIn the thirteenth chapter, that \"every intellect is omni-form.\")\nMagnifico Lorenzo used the dodge,\nSays that he met Ficino\nIn some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner,\nAnd that they walked along, stopped at a well-head,\nAnd heard deep platitudes about contentment\nFrom some old codger with an endless beard.\n\"A daemon is not a particular intellect,\nBut is a substance differed from intellect,\"\nBreaks in Ficino,\n\"Placed in the latitude or locus of souls\"\nThat's out of Proclus, take your pick of them.\nValla, more earth and sounder rhetoric\nPrefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas:\n\"A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences;\nA patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.\"\nThen comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation.\nNo, you've not read your Elegantiae\nA dull book?shook the church.\nThe prefaces, cut clear and hard:\n\"Know then the Roman speech, a sacrament,\"\nSpread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom,\nBread of the liberal arts.\n                                 Ha!

Doughty's \"divine Homeros\"\nCame before sophistry. Justinopolitan\nUncatalogued Andreas Divus,\nGave him in Latin, 1538 in my edition, the rest uncertain,\nCaught up his cadence, word and syllable:\n\"Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail,\nBlack keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice,\nWeeping we went.\"\nI've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa\nAnd cracked my wit on delicate canzoni\n                   Here's but rough meaning:\n\n\"And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers,\nForth on the godly sea;\nWe set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship,\nSheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also\nHeavy with weeping.

And he in heavy speech:\n'Ill fate and abundant wine! I slept in Circe's ingle,\nGoing down the long ladder unguarded, I fell against the buttress,\nShattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.\nBut thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied!\nHeap up mine arms, be tomb by the sea-board, and inscribed,\nA man of no fortune and with a name to come;\nAnd set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.'\nCame then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea,\nAnd then Tiresias, Theban,\nHolding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first:\n'Man of ill hour, why come a second time,\nLeaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?\nStand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever,\nAnd I will speak you true speeches.'\n                                                       \"And I stepped back,\nSheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then\nAnd spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt\nReturn through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,\nLose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.\nCame then Anticlea, to whom I answered:\n'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.'\nI told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow\nFaded in my embrace.\nThen had I news of many faded women\nTyro, Alcmena, Chloris\nHeard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed\nBy sirens and thence outward and away,\nAnd unto Circe buried Elpenor's corpse.\"\n\nLie quiet, Divus.\n                                 In Officina Wechli, Paris,\nM.

We met his eyes\nThat never flinched or turned to compromise,\nAnd Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,\nKnotted and sailor-like, such as no farm\nIn all of Maine could boast of; and away\nHe turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...\nWe walked on leisurely until a bend\nShowed him once more, now working toward the end\nOf one great path; wearing his eighty years\nLike banners lifted in a wind of cheers.\n\nThen we turned off abruptlytook the road\nCutting the village, the one with the commanding\nView of the river. And we strode\nMore briskly now to the long pier that showed\nWhere the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.\nIn the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped\nLeisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped\nMore on than in the water. Smoothly then\nWe shot its nose against the rippling current,\nFeeling the rising rivers half-deterrent\nPull on the paddle as we turned the blade\nTo keep from swerving round; while we delayed\nTo watch the curious wave-eaten locks;\nOr pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....\nBlue eels flew under us, and fishes darted\nA thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.\nAnd over us the wise and noble-hearted\nTwilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,\nAnd we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk\nDown the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,\n\nMotionless in the meadows\nThe trees, the rocks, the cows...\nAnd quiet dripped from the shadows\nLike rain from heavy boughs.\n\nThe tree-toads started ringing\nTheir ceaseless silver bells;\nA land-locked breeze came swinging\nIts censer of earthy smells.\n\nThe rivers tiny canon\nStretched into dusky lands;\nLike a dark and silent companion\nEvening held out her hands.\n\nHushed were the dawns bravados;\nLoud noon was a silenced cry\nAnd quiet slipped from the shadows\nAs stars slip out of the sky...\n\nIt must have been an hour more, or later,\nWhen, tramping homeward through the piney wood,\nWe felt the years fly back; the brotherhood\nOf forests took usand we saw the satyr!\nThere in a pool, up to his neck, he stood\nAnd grinned to see us stare, incredulous\nToo startled to remember fear or flight.\nFeeling the menace in the crafty night,\nWe turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!\nUsing our very names he called. We drew\nWith creaking courage down the avenue\nOf birches till we saw, with clearing sight,\n(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)\nFamiliar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,\nAnd Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!\nThe woods became his background; every tree\nSeemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared\nThe beauty of that gnarled serenity;\nThe quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared\nIts shoulders against Time ... And even night\nFlowed in and out of him, as though content\nWith such a native element;\nHappy to move about a spirit quite\nAs old, as placid and as confident...\nSideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad\nHe leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,\nHis body in the moonlight dripping stars...\n\nWe went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",

    "content": "We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.\nRugged and straight he stood; his body steeled\nWith stubbornness and age. We met his eyes\nThat never flinched or turned to compromise,\nAnd Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,\nKnotted and sailor-like, such as no farm\nIn all of Maine could boast of; and away\nHe turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...\nWe walked on leisurely until a bend\nShowed him once more, now working toward the end\nOf one great path; wearing his eighty years\nLike banners lifted in a wind of cheers.\n\nThen we turned off abruptlytook the road\nCutting the village, the one with the commanding\nView of the river. And we strode\nMore briskly now to the long pier that showed\nWhere the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.\nIn the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped\nLeisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped\nMore on than in the water. Smoothly then\nWe shot its nose against the rippling current,\nFeeling the rising rivers half-deterrent\nPull on the paddle as we turned the blade\nTo keep from swerving round; while we delayed\nTo watch the curious wave-eaten locks;\nOr pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....\nBlue eels flew under us, and fishes darted\nA thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.\nAnd over us the wise and noble-hearted\nTwilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,\nAnd we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk\nDown the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,\n\nMotionless in the meadows\nThe trees, the rocks, the cows...\nAnd quiet dripped from the shadows\nLike rain from heavy boughs.\n\nThe tree-toads started ringing\nTheir ceaseless silver bells;\nA land-locked breeze came swinging\nIts censer of earthy smells.\n\nThe rivers tiny canon\nStretched into dusky lands;\nLike a dark and silent companion\nEvening held out her hands.\n\nHushed were the dawns bravados;\nLoud noon was a silenced cry\nAnd quiet slipped from the shadows\nAs stars slip out of the sky...\n\nIt must have been an hour more, or later,\nWhen, tramping homeward through the piney wood,\nWe felt the years fly back; the brotherhood\nOf forests took usand we saw the satyr!\nThere in a pool, up to his neck, he stood\nAnd grinned to see us stare, incredulous\nToo startled to remember fear or flight.\nFeeling the menace in the crafty night,\nWe turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!\nUsing our very names he called. We drew\nWith creaking courage down the avenue\nOf birches till we saw, with clearing sight,\n(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)\nFamiliar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,\nAnd Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!\nThe woods became his background; every tree\nSeemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared\nThe beauty of that gnarled serenity;\nThe quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared\nIts shoulders against Time ... And even night\nFlowed in and out of him, as though content\nWith such a native element;\nHappy to move about a spirit quite\nAs old, as placid and as confident...\nSideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad\nHe leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,\nHis body in the moonlight dripping stars...\n\nWe went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",

Coldly afflicted,\nMy feet were by frost benumbed.\nChill its chains are; chafing sighs\nHew my heart round and hunger begot\nMere-weary mood. Lest man know not\nThat he on dry land loveliest liveth,\nList how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,\nWeathered the winter, wretched outcast\nDeprived of my kinsmen;\nHung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,\nThere I heard naught save the harsh sea\nAnd ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,\nDid for my games the gannet's clamour,\nSea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,\nThe mews' singing all my mead-drink.\nStorms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern\nIn icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed\nWith spray on his pinion.\nNot any protector\nMay make merry man faring needy.\nThis he little believes, who aye in winsome life\nAbides 'mid burghers some heavy business,\nWealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft\nMust bide above brine.\nNeareth nightshade, snoweth from north,\nFrost froze the land, hail fell on earth then\nCorn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now\nThe heart's thought that I on high streams\nThe salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.\nMoaneth alway my mind's lust\nThat I fare forth, that I afar hence\nSeek out a foreign fastness.\nFor this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,\nNot though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;\nNor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful\nBut shall have his sorrow for sea-fare\nWhatever his lord will.\nHe hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having\nNor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight\nNor any whit else save the wave's slash,\nYet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.\nBosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,\nFields to fairness, land fares brisker,\nAll this admonisheth man eager of mood,\nThe heart turns to travel so that he then thinks\nOn flood-ways to be far departing.\nCuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,\nHe singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,\nThe bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not \nHe the prosperous man  what some perform\nWhere wandering them widest draweth.\nSo that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,\nMy mood 'mid the mere-flood,\nOver the whale's acre, would wander wide.\nOn earth's shelter cometh oft to me,\nEager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,\nWhets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,\nO'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow\nMy lord deems to me this dead life\nOn loan and on land, I believe not\nThat any earth-weal eternal standeth\nSave there be somewhat calamitous\nThat, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.\nDisease or oldness or sword-hate\nBeats out the breath from doom-gripped body.\nAnd for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after \nLaud of the living, boasteth some last word,\nThat he will work ere he pass onward,\nFrame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,\nDaring ado, ...\nSo that all men shall honour him after\nAnd his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,\nAye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,\nDelight mid the doughty.\nDays little durable,\nAnd all arrogance of earthen riches,\nThere come now no kings nor Csars\nNor gold-giving lords like those gone.\nHowe'er in mirth most magnified,\nWhoe'er lived in life most lordliest,\nDrear all this excellence, delights undurable!\nWaneth the watch, but the world holdeth.\nTomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.\nEarthly glory ageth and seareth.\nNo man at all going the earth's gait,\nBut age fares against him, his face paleth,\nGrey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,\nLordly men are to earth o'ergiven,\nNor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,\nNor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,\nNor stir hand nor think in mid heart,\nAnd though he strew the grave with gold,\nHis born brothers, their buried bodies\nBe an unlikely treasure hoard.",

We have found you! Everywhere\nWe sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!\n\nOh but the water loves me and folds me,\nPlays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!\nNo longer shadow!  and it holds me\nClose, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.\n\nSun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!\nWings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!\nAll that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs\nIn confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.",

God, I am caught in a snare!\nI know not what fine wire is round my throat,\nI only know I let him finger there\nMy pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat\nWho sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:\nAnd down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down\nHis dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood\nUpon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood\nOf sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown\nWithin him, die, and find death good.",

I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\n\nI grow old ... I grow old ...\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\n\nShall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\n\nI do not think that they will sing to me.\n\nI have seen them riding seaward on the waves\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\nWe have lingered in the chambers of the sea\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.",

I myself can hardly understand.\nWe must leave it now to fate.\nYou will write, at any rate.\nPerhaps it is not too late.\nI shall sit here, serving tea to friends.\"\nAnd I must borrow every changing shape\nTo find expression ... dance, dance\nLike a dancing bear,\nCry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.\nLet us take the air, in a tobacco trance\nWell! and what if she should die some afternoon,\nAfternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;\nShould die and leave me sitting pen in hand\nWith the smoke coming down above the housetops;\nDoubtful, for quite a while\nNot knowing what to feel or if I understand\nOr whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...\nWould she not have the advantage, after all?\nThis music is successful with a \"dying fall\"\nNow that we talk of dying\nAnd should I have the right to smile?",
